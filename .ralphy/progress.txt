# Task Progress Log

## DECK-006: Create Insurance Prep & Team Performance Templates
**Status:** Verified Complete
**Date:** 2026-01-21

### Summary
Verified that both Insurance Prep and Team Performance templates are fully implemented and integrated into the deck generator feature.

### Files Verified/Implemented

#### Template Files
1. `src/features/deck-generator/templates/insurance-prep.ts`
   - Template ID: `insurance-prep`
   - Name: "Insurance Adjuster Prep Pack"
   - Audience: Sales representatives
   - 6 sections: title, claim-overview, damage-documentation, carrier-intel, negotiation-points, documentation-checklist
   - Includes AI-enhanced sections for carrier intel and negotiation points
   - Uses guardianBrandConfig branding

2. `src/features/deck-generator/templates/team-performance.ts`
   - Template ID: `team-performance`
   - Name: "Team Performance Report"
   - Audience: Leadership
   - 7 sections: title, kpi-summary, revenue-trend, leaderboard, coaching-opportunities, pipeline-health, insights
   - Includes AI-enhanced sections for coaching opportunities and insights
   - Uses guardianBrandConfig branding

#### Registration
- Both templates are imported and exported in `src/features/deck-generator/templates/index.ts`
- Templates are included in the `deckTemplates` array
- Helper functions (getTemplateById, getTemplatesByAudience, etc.) support both templates

#### Data Aggregator Functions
All data source functions implemented in `src/features/deck-generator/utils/dataAggregator.ts`:

**Insurance Prep:**
- `getInsurancePrepTitleData(customerId)` - Fetches customer/carrier info for title slide
- `getClaimOverviewStats(customerId)` - Returns claim number, date, value, deductible
- `getDamageDocumentation()` - Lists itemized damage with icons
- `getCarrierIntel(customerId)` - Shows approval rates, processing times
- `generateNegotiationPoints()` - AI-generated negotiation talking points
- `getDocumentationChecklist()` - Pre-meeting preparation checklist

**Team Performance:**
- `getTeamReportTitleData()` - Report title and metadata
- `getTeamKPIStats(teamId?, dateRange?)` - Key performance metrics
- `getLeaderboardData(teamId?)` - Top performers list
- `getRevenueTrendData(teamId?, dateRange?)` - Weekly revenue chart
- `getCoachingOpportunities()` - AI-identified improvement areas
- `getPipelineHealthData()` - Pipeline stage breakdown
- `generatePerformanceInsights()` - AI strategic recommendations

All functions are registered in `dataSourceRegistry` for dynamic calling via `fetchDataForSlide()`.

### Type Safety
Both templates use proper TypeScript types:
- `DeckTemplate` interface for template definitions
- `SlideSection` interface for each section
- Proper content types: `TitleSlideContent`, `StatsSlideContent`, `ListSlideContent`, `ChartSlideContent`, `TalkingPointsSlideContent`

### Notes
- The task was found to be already complete upon investigation
- Both templates follow the established patterns from other templates (customer-cheat-sheet, storm-deployment, etc.)
- No modifications were needed - verified existing implementation meets requirements
